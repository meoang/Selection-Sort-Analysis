# Selection-Sort-Analysis
Compares iterative and recursive implementations of Selection Sort.

Runs each sorting method 50 times each for a variety of data sizes.  For example, 50 times with 5 elements, 50 times with 10 elements, 50 times with 100 elements, and so on.

Records the critical operation count and time for each sort.  Critical operations chosen are searches for minimum values and swaps performed.

Calculates the standard deviations of critical operation count and time, then displays a chart of the results.
